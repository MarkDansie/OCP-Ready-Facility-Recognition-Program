**OCP Ready™ Facility Recognition Program**

This file “Colo Site Assessment 2020A” includes our colo site assessment for use in the OCP Facility Recognition program.  The checklist allows for a colo solution provider (Colo SP) to verify that a colocation data center facility meets the OCP Ready requirements.  If the data center 'COMPLETE MEETS REQUIREMENTS' then the Colo SP can seek OCP Ready certification from the Open Compute Project Foundation.

A description of each worksheet in the file:

The “**Revision, License & Use**” worksheet provides information on the version history and creative commons licensing.

The “**Checklist**” worksheet provides a checklist for 'Personal Information Release', 'License and Membership Requirement' must haves and 'Facility/Site Specific Requirement' information and also for the use of the data center facility project leads and incubation committee representative, for the colo site assessment approval aspect of the process.

The “**Site Assessment**" worksheet allows the user to select a parameter for each data center sub-system attribute, which closely matches the specification of the facility that is being assessed. The sub-system attributes within the table are split into two classification sections 'REQUIREMENTS' Row 13:61 which are the 'must haves', and each selection must result in an Optimum or Acceptable result for the 'Self Assessment Status' to change from 'NOT COMPLETED' to 'COMPLETE MEETS REQUIREMENTS'. The other classification section is 'CONSIDERATIONS' from Row 63:78 which are the sub-system attributes that are for information only, and an Optimum or Acceptable result are not required for the 'Self Assessment Status' to change from 'NOT COMPLETED' to 'COMPLETE MEETS REQUIREMENTS'. It is necessary though that a parameter is selected for each of the attributes to allow the 'Self Assessment Status' to change.

The “**Dropdown**" worksheet contains a list of names for the foundation, project leads and incubation committee representative.

We will welcome all questions and constructive criticism and feedback.
